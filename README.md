# MDLC
Machine Driven Literature Classification

MCLC identifies latent topics or themes in document analyses, including (but not limited to) systematic literature reviews. This framework allows for the assessment of the optimal number of topics in a set of documents and/or research articles. Outputs will allow access to the classified list of documents and latent codes along with dynamic HTML summaries.
